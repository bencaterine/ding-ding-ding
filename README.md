STAT 303-2 Project

`data/flights.csv` and `data/flights_clean.csv` are too large to add to GitHub.

Download [flights.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv) and place in `data` directory.

Run `data-cleaning.ipynb` which will write `flights_clean.csv` to `data` directory.
