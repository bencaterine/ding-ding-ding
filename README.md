`data/flights.csv`, `data/flights_clean.csv`, and `data/city_temperature.csv` are too large to add to GitHub.

Download [flights.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv) and place in `data` directory.

Run `data-cleaning.ipynb` which will write `flights_clean.csv` to `data` directory.

Download [city_temperature.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities) and place in `data` directory.
