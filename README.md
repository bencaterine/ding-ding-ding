## STAT 303-2 Project

Instructions to set up local repository:

1. Download [flights.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv) and place it in the `data` directory.

2. Download [city_temperature.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities) and place in `data` directory.

3. Run `data-cleaning.ipynb` which will write `flights_clean.csv` into the `data` directory.

All other files should use `flights_clean.csv` to perform EDA and modeling.

Note: These steps are necessary because these two `csv` files are too large to add to GitHub.
